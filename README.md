A small RDBMS project for college assignment.
Basically its a prototype for a car showroom system providing basic functionality for login and registration of both customers and dealers.
Currently its only having the login/registration , option for the dealer to add or delete cars , a dealer can view and delete only the cars they've added..
We planned to add a booking facility, which is partially implemented but right now the project is abondened due to time constraints and college work...

Feel free to use it as a basic framework for your future projects...
